## Overview: What Gets Added Later

ProPresenter Lyrics Export focuses on one thing: **extracting and exporting song lyrics from your worship library**. But a complete Sunday service presentation in ProPresenter typically includes:

| Content Type | Method | Format | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Song Lyrics** | ProPresenter Lyrics Export | PPTX + Audio | Congregation singing |
| **Sermon** | Import PowerPoint as Images | PPTX → Images | Main message |
| **Kids' Content** | Import PowerPoint as Images | PPTX → Images | Children's service |
| **Announcements** | Service Generator (optional) | Text + Images | Important notices |
| **Birthday Blessings** | Import PowerPoint | PPTX (editable) | Celebrate congregants |

This guide focuses on the manual imports (Sermon, Kids' Content, Birthday Blessings) that come **after** you've exported your lyrics.

## Sermon Content (Main Service)

Your sermon is typically delivered with visual support—slides, graphics, video, or photo backgrounds. Here's how to bring that into ProPresenter.

### Import PowerPoint as Images (Recommended)

The easiest way to import your sermon slides is to use ProPresenter's **Import PowerPoint as Images** feature. This converts each slide in your sermon PowerPoint into an image-based slide in ProPresenter.

#### Step-by-Step: Import Sermon PowerPoint

1. **Prepare your sermon PowerPoint**
   - Create your sermon slides in PowerPoint as usual
   - Save the file (e.g., `Sermon_2026_02_09.pptx`)
   - No need to export individual images—ProPresenter handles the conversion

2. **In ProPresenter:**
   - Right-click on your target playlist (or service playlist)
   - Select **Import** → **PowerPoint as Images**
   - Browse to your sermon PowerPoint file
   - ProPresenter will convert each slide to an image and create slides in order

3. **Position in playlist**
   - Drag the imported sermon presentation to the correct position in your service flow
   - Typically between songs or as a dedicated sermon section

#### Best Practices for Sermon PowerPoint

- **Resolution**: Design slides at 1920x1080 for optimal projection quality
- **Aspect ratio**: Match your presentation display (usually 16:9)
- **Fonts**: Use standard fonts that render well when converted to images
- **Organization**: Keep one PowerPoint per sermon for easy reuse and updates

### When to Use PowerPoint as Images Import

✓ Sermon PowerPoint presentations
✓ Any PowerPoint slides you want displayed as static images
✓ Canva or other tools that export to PowerPoint format
✓ Multi-slide teachings with visual progression

## Kids' Sermon Content

Kids' content follows the same import process as main sermon content, using ProPresenter's **Import PowerPoint as Images** feature.

### Import Kids' PowerPoint as Images

Kids' sermons often rely on colorful graphics and engaging visuals. Import them the same way as main sermon content:

1. **Prepare your kids' PowerPoint**
   - Create your kids' sermon slides in PowerPoint
   - Save the file (e.g., `Kids_2026_02_09.pptx`)

2. **In ProPresenter:**
   - Right-click on your **Kids Library** or kids playlist
   - Select **Import** → **PowerPoint as Images**
   - Select your kids' PowerPoint file
   - ProPresenter converts each slide to an image

3. **Position in service**
   - Place the imported kids' section where your children's service occurs
   - Typically right after opening songs and before kids dismiss

#### Special Considerations for Kids' Content

- **Bright colors**: Kids' content should be visually engaging
- **Large text**: If text is included, use fonts ≥32pt for kids to read
- **Shorter sequences**: Kids' attention spans are shorter—fewer slides work better
- **Consistency**: Use the same design style week-to-week for brand recognition

## Birthday Bucket / Birthday Blessings

Birthday Blessings is a special feature in ProPresenter that displays birthday announcements with customizable text and animations. Rather than importing static images, you'll work with **editable PowerPoint presentations** that you can customize.

### Method: Import PowerPoint for Birthday Bucket

Birthday Blessings work best when imported as a PowerPoint presentation, which allows you to:
- Edit names and dates directly
- Customize the greeting message
- Adjust fonts, colors, and animations
- Reuse the template each week

#### Step-by-Step: Import Birthday Blessing PowerPoint

1. **Prepare your PowerPoint template**
   - Create a PowerPoint file with placeholder slides (one per birthday)
   - Each slide should have:
     - Name (editable text field)
     - Birthday date or age
     - Custom message or greeting
     - Optional: Birthday graphics or animations

2. **In ProPresenter:**
   - Right-click on your target playlist
   - Select **Import** → **PowerPoint File**
   - Browse and select your birthday blessing PowerPoint
   - ProPresenter converts each slide to an editable presentation

3. **Edit the presentation in ProPresenter**
   - Double-click each birthday slide to edit
   - Update the name to the birthday person
   - Adjust text formatting if needed
   - Save changes

4. **Position in service**
   - Place birthday slides near the end of your service
   - Often used during announcements or closing time

#### PowerPoint Template Tips

**Template Structure:**
```
Slide 1: Birthday Blessing Template (title/instructions)
Slide 2: [Name] Birthday Slide
Slide 3: [Name] Birthday Slide
...
```

**Editable Elements:**
- Text boxes with names (change names week-to-week)
- Dates or age fields
- Custom messages
- Birthday graphics or backgrounds

**Formatting Notes:**
- ⚠️ After importing to ProPresenter, double-check your formatting
- Some fonts may change slightly
- Animations may need adjustment
- Test the display on your actual projection screen

#### Best Practices for Birthday Blessings

✓ Use consistent formatting across all birthday slides
✓ Keep text large and readable from a distance (≥28pt)
✓ Include a default slide for "other birthdays" in the month
✓ Add subtle animations for visual interest (optional)
✓ Update the template 1-2 weeks before using (not during service)

## Best Practices

### Workflow Integration

**Your complete Sunday service workflow should look like:**

1. **Export lyrics** → ProPresenter Lyrics Export (creates PPTX with song lyrics)
2. **Add sermon content** → Import PowerPoint as Images (you handle this)
3. **Add kids' content** → Import PowerPoint as Images (you handle this)
4. **Add birthday blessings** → Import PowerPoint template (you handle this)
5. **Arrange playlist** → Drag items into service order in ProPresenter
6. **Test and preview** → Run through the service once before Sunday

### File Organization

Keep your content organized for faster workflow:

```
2026_02_09_Sunday_Service/
├── Lyrics_Export.pptx          (from ProPresenter Lyrics Export)
├── Sermon_2026_02_09.pptx      (import as images in ProPresenter)
├── Kids_2026_02_09.pptx        (import as images in ProPresenter)
└── Birthday_Blessing_2026_02.pptx
```
