## Connection Settings

### Finding Your Host and Port

**Local Machine:**
- Host: `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`
- Port: Usually `1025` (check ProPresenter preferences)

**Remote Machine:**
- Host: IP address of the ProPresenter computer (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
- Port: ProPresenter's Network API port

### How to Find ProPresenter Settings

1. Open ProPresenter 7
2. Go to **Preferences** → **Network**
3. Look for:
   - **Enable Network API** checkbox (must be enabled)
   - **Port** field (note this number)
   - **Host IP** (if remote, find this on the ProPresenter computer)

### Network Firewall

If connecting to a remote ProPresenter:
- Ensure the network allows traffic on the ProPresenter port
- The port must be open on the ProPresenter computer's firewall
- ProPresenter must be running

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"Connection refused" or "Network error"**
1. Verify ProPresenter is running
2. Check Network API is enabled (Preferences → Network)
3. Verify host and port are correct
4. Try from the ProPresenter computer first (use `127.0.0.1`)

**"Connection timed out"**
1. Check firewall rules
2. Verify the ProPresenter IP address is correct
3. Ensure the port is open
4. Try `status` command with `--debug` flag for more info

### Export Issues

**PowerPoint file is empty or has missing lyrics**
1. Verify the playlist contains presentations
2. Check that the library filter matches your songs
3. Try with no library filter (leave blank) to see all items

**Font not appearing in exported PPTX**
1. Ensure the font is installed on the system where PPTX will be opened
2. Use a system font (Arial, Helvetica, etc.) for guaranteed compatibility
3. Check the font dropdown to see installation status

### macOS Issues

**"App is damaged and can't be opened"**
```bash
xattr -cr "/path/to/ProPresenter Lyrics.app"
```

**App won't launch**
- Try right-click → Open (instead of double-click)
- Check System Preferences → Security for app permissions

### Windows Issues

**"Windows protected your PC"**
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. Grant administrator permissions if prompted

**Command not recognized**
- Ensure the executable is in your PATH
- Use full path: `C:\Tools\propresenter-lyrics-win-x64.exe status`

## Tips & Tricks

### Batch Processing
Use the CLI to automate exports:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for uuid in abc123 def456 ghi789; do
  propresenter-lyrics pptx "$uuid" "output-$uuid"
done
```

### Custom Font Setup
1. Download fonts from Google Fonts
2. Install on your system
3. Use the font dropdown in settings
4. Click "Refresh" after installation

### PPTX Styling
- **Dark slides:** Use light text colors (white, light gray)
- **Light slides:** Use dark text colors (black, dark gray)
- **Readability:** Keep font sizes 40pt+ for audience visibility
- **Branding:** Add your logo on title slides for consistency

### Remote ProPresenter
For a computer on your network:
1. Find its IP (Windows: `ipconfig`, macOS: `ifconfig`)
2. Enable Network API on that computer
3. Connect from another machine using that IP and port
4. Ensure network allows the connection
